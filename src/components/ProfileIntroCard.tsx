            I am an application development student at STI with a passion for
            technology and problem-solving. I have experience in both front-end
            and back-end development, including skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
            React, Kotlin, and Swift. Currently, I'm interning as an app
            developer at Pixlo in Stockholm, where I apply my knowledge in
            real-world projects. I am always eager to learn, grow, and
            contribute to innovative solutions while pursuing my passion for
            design and technology.
